 <h2> <em> <u>Packrunner B*tch Lyrics </u></em> </h2>           
    [Intro]
Fuck you, mane!<br>
<br>
    
[Verse 1]<br>
B-B-Beamer M6, baby, it's just me and you (I'm so done with you, Summrs)<br>
With the crew, I'm sippin' goop <br>
Smokin' out the pound, I'm feelin' loose<br>
She wanna be a Packrunner bitch (Ayy)<br>
Let's hit Melrose and buy expensive shit<br>
If a bitch fuck with you then we get lit<br>
She with me, she know that I'm the shit (Yeah, yeah)<br>
Hit licks in my Nike TNs (Ayy, yeah, yeah)<br>
You broke my scale, baby, BMS (Ayy, yeah, yeah)<br>
I get all the lean from CVS (Lean, yeah)<br>
Leave your ex-nigga, he a pest<br>
Buy you what you want, never stress (Never stress)<br>
I just gotta get this off my chest<br>
You the realest and I put that on my set<br>
Babe, let's take off in a jet<br>
Fuck you, mane!<br>
(Yeah, ayy, yeah)<br>
<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
She wanna come hop in the coupe, she wanna come ride with the gang<br>
She know that she is my boo, she wanna wear all of my chains<br>
That choppa came with attachments, bitch, you know that I'm havin' that bang<br>
You the highlight of my life<br>
Bitch, I'm sippin' dirty Sprite<br>
F and N wit' a scope, bitch, I don't really wanna fight<br>
I can't fuck with no broke bitch, she ridin' that dick like a bike (Ayy)<br>
Yeah, pull up, hop out, we slidin' in that Fisker (Yeah)<br>
Three grams in my wood, I can't fuck with no Swishers<br>
I want you, no cap, I'm not a bullshitter<br>
You can be my missus, I can be your mister<br>
We sippin' on that lean, baby, this is not no liquor<br>
I been gettin' guap but I need to get richer<br>
I need to get richer<br>
I need to get richer, I need to get richer<br>
Fuck you, mane!<br>
<br>

[Chorus]<br>
She wanna be a Packrunner bitch, Packrunner bitch<br>
Come to my crib and wear all my shit<br>
She wanna take hella trips, buy expensive shit (Yeah)<br>
Packrunner bitch, that's my Packrunner bitch<br>
Wanna wear all my shit, come to my crib (Yeah)<br>
Suck out my kids, ayy<br>
She wanna eat all my kids, buy expensive shit<br>
<br>

[Outro]<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
She wanna be a Packrunner bitch<br>
Wanna be a Packrunner bitch<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
